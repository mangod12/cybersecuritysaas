# CyberSec Alert SaaS

Production-deployed vulnerability intelligence platform that aggregates CVEs from multiple authoritative sources and automatically correlates them with enterprise assets to generate real-time prioritized alerts.

## Overview

CyberSec Alert SaaS solves a real operational security problem:

Security teams receive thousands of vulnerability disclosures daily. Most are irrelevant. Manual triage is inefficient and error-prone.

This system:

* Aggregates CVEs from NVD, Microsoft MSRC, Cisco PSIRT, Red Hat, and RSS feeds
* Enriches vulnerabilities with CVSS scoring
* Correlates vulnerabilities against user-managed asset inventory
* Automatically generates targeted alerts
* Reduces alert fatigue through asset-based filtering
* Provides centralized dashboard + notification workflows
