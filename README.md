# CyberSec Alert SaaS

[![CI](https://github.com/mangod12/cybersecuritysaas/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mangod12/cybersecuritysaas/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

OneAlert 2.0 is an industrial-grade vulnerability intelligence platform built for hybrid IT/OT environments. It combines multi-source CVE aggregation with passive OT discovery, industrial advisory ingestion, and asset-aware alerting to reduce risk across enterprise and operational technology estates.

🚀 **Live Demo:**
[https://cybersec-saas-zjfau6dqcq-uc.a.run.app/](https://cybersec-saas-zjfau6dqcq-uc.a.run.app/)

🧪 **Demo Login:**
- Email: `admin@example.com` / Password: `password123`
- Or use **GitHub OAuth** login

**Tech:** FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + PostgreSQL/Cloud SQL + Cloud Run + Cloud Build CI/CD

## Overview

Security teams are flooded with advisories, while OT teams need context that generic scanners rarely provide. OneAlert 2.0 addresses this by unifying vulnerability intelligence and OT-aware asset context in one workflow.

This platform:

* Aggregates vulnerabilities and advisories from NVD, MSRC, Cisco, Red Hat, CISA KEV, and ICS/vendor sources
* Performs passive network asset discovery with sensor support
* Detects industrial protocols and classifies assets by Purdue-style network zones
* Scores risk using vulnerability, exposure, and criticality factors
* Correlates alerts directly to discovered and managed OT/IT assets
* Supports notification and cloud-native deployment patterns

## Quick Start

### Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Setup database (creates tables and seeds demo user)
python scripts/setup_database.py

# Run development server
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
```

Visit: http://localhost:8000/app/

For OT onboarding (sensors, discovered devices, correlation, and analytics), see [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md).

### Production Deployment (Google Cloud Run)

**Automatic deployment is configured!** Just push to `main`:

```bash
git push origin main
```

The Cloud Build trigger automatically builds and deploys to Cloud Run.

**First-time setup:**
1. Follow [CLOUD_SQL_SETUP.md](CLOUD_SQL_SETUP.md) to create PostgreSQL database
2. Or run the automated script in Cloud Shell:
   ```bash
   bash scripts/setup_cloud_sql.sh YOUR_PROJECT_ID
   ```

---

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure:

**Required:**
- `SECRET_KEY` - Random secret for JWT signing
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string

**Optional:**
- `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` / `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` - For GitHub OAuth
- `MAILGUN_API_KEY` / `MAILGUN_DOMAIN` - For email alerts
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` / `GENERIC_WEBHOOK_URL` - For external alert delivery
- `NVD_API_KEY` - For CVE data (higher rate limits)

See [.env.example](.env.example) for full configuration options.

## Roadmap

* CPE-based asset matching
* EPSS integration
* Slack & Teams notifications
* OT protocol-level scanning and topology awareness
* Role-based access control (RBAC)
* Multi-tenant architecture
* CI/CD pipeline automation
