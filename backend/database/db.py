"""
Database connection and session management.

This module handles the setup of SQLAlchemy database engines and sessions
for both synchronous and asynchronous operations. It supports SQLite for
development and PostgreSQL for production, configured via environment variables.

Key components:
- `Base`: Declarative base for SQLAlchemy models.
- `get_engine()`: Returns a lazily initialized synchronous SQLAlchemy engine.
- `get_async_engine()`: Returns a lazily initialized asynchronous SQLAlchemy engine.
- `SessionLocal`: A factory for creating synchronous database sessions.
- `AsyncSessionLocal`: A factory for creating asynchronous database sessions.
- `get_db()`: FastAPI dependency for synchronous database sessions.
- `get_async_db()`: FastAPI dependency for asynchronous database sessions.
